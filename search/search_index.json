You can get a brief introduction to the use of branches here: https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches 1. Prepare your Git branch Basically you need to do the following to create a new branch locally and on the Github repo: git pull git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] 2. Make changes Note If you are making a new lab, then jump over to \"Make first changes for new lab\" on Create new lab . Locate the labs folder under the /MkDocs, e.g. /MkDocs/monitor_8.2 Make the changes in the markdown files, image files, and mkdocs.yml file. Remember to do this: Update the about.md file with Contributors and Change Information. Update the index.md file with a new Updated date (at the end of the file). In the terminal navigate to the root of this git repo and execute the build script: ./build_all_mkdocs.sh Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in order to verify that your changes look as expected. Tip Press control-c to stop the web server and get back to the prompt. 3. Commit and push your changes When you are satisfied with your contribution take a look at the changes you have created in git: git status Add those files to git: git add . Commit the changes: git commit -sm \"Write a descriptive message of your changes\" Push the changes to the Github branch: git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] Note Repeate step 2 and 3 until you have fulfilled the purpose of your branch. 4. Create Pull request Go to the Github repository https://github.com/IBM/monitor-hands-on-lab Select your branch in the dropdown box: Create a Pull request: Give it a title and description. Hit the Create pull request button. Remember to do this: Ask Carlos Ferreia (carlos.ferreira1@ibm.com) to review and accept your Pull Request. 5. Clean up branches locally and remotely (Github) Once the Pull request has been accepted and your commits are added to the master branch, it is time to clean up the branch locally and remotely (on Github). git checkout master git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch] git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch] Note The : before the [name_of_your_new_branch] in the last command will delete it on Github.

Make changes\", so follow this process: Follow step \"1. Prepare your Git branch\" under Add content . Come back here and run the below \"Make first changes for new lab\". Go back to Add content and run from step 3. (You are done here :-) Make first changes for new lab The following steps are used to crate a new lab based on the provided template 1. Replicate Template to your lab Select the template_1.0 folder Make a copy of the template_1.0 folder Rename the template_1.0 copy folder to < product >_< version > for wich this new lab is intended, e.g. mvi_saas Also rename the folder under img/template_1.0 using the same name lab name, e.g. img/mvi_saas . Save the file. Important It is important that this structure is kept consistent cross all labs in order to easily build and deploy the complete set of labs. 2. Modify the mkdocs.yml file The mkdocs.yml file holds the configuration of the new lab, i.e. some generic information about the new lab, like location of where the site will be created during the build and also which .md (markdown) files it consist of based on the navigation information. Select and open the mkdocs.yml file located in the root of you new lab folder Edit the marked areas suitable for your new lab Which could look like this Save the file. Note The nav: definition holds the navigation menu for the new lab. It is only the index.md and about.md that need to have some mandatory information, as explained below. The rest of the markdown files and navigation menu is defined by the way the lab is structured and how many exercises it consist of. 3. Modify the index.md file The index.md file is the landing / welcome page for the new lab. Select and open the index.md file located in the docs folder of you new lab Edit the file and make sure to change the marked areas suitable for your new lab Which could look like this Save the file. Remember to do this: Update the Updated at the end of this file to current date once the new lab is ready. 4. Modify the about.md file The about.md file contains a list of the contributors to this lab as well as the Change Information. Select and open the about.md file located in the docs folder of you new lab Edit the file and make sure to change the marked areas suitable for your new lab Which could look like this Save the file. Remember to do this: Update both sections when the lab is ready. 5. Add the new lab to the build script First we need to update the build_all_mkdocs.sh file located in the root of the monitor-hands-on-lab folder. This file contains the shell script for building the entire IBM Maximo Labs static web site. Select and open the build_all_mkdocs.sh file Scroll down to find # Build the template level: Copy the section and paste it above the #### DON't CHANGE THE BELOW MANDATORY... line. Change the comment and the lab= variable to match the folder of the new lab. Save the file. Attention Please don't change anything else! 6. Build and verify your lab content In a terminal navigate to the root of this git repo and execute the build script: ./build_all_mkdocs.sh It could look like this: Wait until it has finished building the whole site. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in order to verify that the build was successful. If the new lab has not yet been added to the index.md in the toplevel page, then navigate directly to the new lab http://localhost:8080/mvi_saas in order to verify that your changes look as expected. Tip Press control-c to stop the web server and get back to the prompt. Congratulations, you have now created the foundation for the new lab following the structure and consistensy of the entire IBM Maximo Labs site. Now you \"only\" need to add all the content to the foundation, by adding markdown files and images according to the structure. Remember to do this: Go back to Add content and run from step 3.

Basically only contain the build script and the MkDocs folder with all the MkDocs content folders. A separate folder for each lab in the form _ e.g. monitor_8.2.
